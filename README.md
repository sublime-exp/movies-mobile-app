## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following content:

   ```env
   
   EXPO_PUBLIC_MOVIE_API_KEY=
   
   EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=
   
   EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=
   
   EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID=
      ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start --clear


In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
